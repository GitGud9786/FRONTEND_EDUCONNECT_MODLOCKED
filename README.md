# EDUCONNECT

## Description
EDUCONNECT is a comprehensive university management system designed to streamline and unify all academic and administrative processes within a single platform. Unlike existing solutions that require multiple apps (e.g., Google Classroom, Google Meet, and separate university's own application for management, enrollments, results, and announcements), EDUCONNECT integrates all these functionalities into one cohesive system. 

With EDUCONNECT, universities can manage student and teacher enrollment, course creation, online classes, assignments, grading, announcements, and moreâ€”all in one place. This eliminates the need for multiple platforms and provides a seamless experience for admins, teachers, and students.

# EDUCONNECT

## Description
EDUCONNECT is a comprehensive university management system designed to streamline and unify all academic and administrative processes within a single platform. Unlike existing solutions that require multiple apps (e.g., Google Classroom, Google Meet, and separate university's own application for management, enrollments, results, and announcements), EDUCONNECT integrates all these functionalities into one cohesive system. 

With EDUCONNECT, universities can manage student and teacher enrollment, course creation, online classes, assignments, grading, announcements, and moreâ€”all in one place. This eliminates the need for multiple platforms and provides a seamless experience for admins, teachers, and students.

## Features

### **Admin Features**
- **Student/Faculty Management**: Enroll students, teachers into the university or system.
- **Department and Course Creation**: Create and manage departments and courses.
- **Teacher Assignment**: Assign teachers to specific courses.
- **Student Enrollment**: Enroll students into courses.
- **System Oversight**: Monitor and manage the overall system.

### **Teacher Features**

- **Online Classes**: Conduct live online classes.
- **File and Assignment Upload**: Share files and assignments with students.
- **Grading**: Grade students' assignments and exams.
- **Calendar**: Manage events, reminders, and schedules.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
